# 01. Executive & Product Vision

## 1.1 Product Mission & Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**
Every day, a generation of stories, wisdom, and family history is lost as seniors pass away without documenting their lives. Traditional methods of biography (writing, hiring a ghostwriter) are time-consuming, expensive, or physically difficult for seniors. Families struggle to bridge the generational gap and preserve their legacy in a meaningful, accessible format.

**Mission:**
To democratize the preservation of human legacy by creating "Recall," an empathetic, AI-powered active living biographer. We aim to capture, structure, and immortalize the life stories of seniors through natural, voice-first conversations anchored by visual memories.

## 1.2 Target Users & Personas

### **Primary User: "The Storyteller" (Senior)**
- **Demographics:** Age 70+, retired, varying levels of tech-literacy.
- **Goals:** Share their life story, feel heard/valued, leave a legacy for grandkids.
- **Pain Points:** Typing is difficult; memory can be foggy; "blank page syndrome" (don't know where to start).
- **Behavior:** Prefers talking over typing; appreciates patience and prompting.

### **Secondary User: "The Custodian" (Family Member)**
- **Demographics:** Age 30-60, child or grandchild of the Storyteller.
- **Goals:** Preserve family history, better understand their parents, create a keepsake.
- **Pain Points:** Guilt over not calling enough; lack of time to interview parents personally.
- **Behavior:** Sets up the account; consumes the output (Chapters, Storybooks); manages subscription.

## 1.3 Value Proposition

1.  **Zero-Friction Capture:** No typing required. The interface is voice-first, designed for accessibility.
2.  **Proustian Triggers:** "Visual Memory Anchoring" uses personal photos to unlock deep, specific memories that text prompts miss.
3.  **Active Listening:** The AI "Director" doesn't just record; it asks follow-up questions, detects emotion, and steers the conversation like a professional interviewer.
4.  **Structured Output:** Raw audio is transformed into polished, chronological "Chapters" and "Storybooks" suitable for printing or sharing.

## 1.5 Non-Goals & Exclusions

-   **Not a Medical Device:** Recall is not a diagnostic tool for dementia or Alzheimer's, though it is dementia-friendly.
-   **Not a Social Network:** There is no public feed. Stories are private by default, shared only with invited family.
-   **Not a General Assistant:** Recall does not set timers, check weather, or order groceries. It is strictly a biographer.

## 1.6 Assumptions & Constraints

-   **Connectivity:** Users have stable internet (WiFi/4G) sufficient for audio streaming.
-   **Hardware:** Users have a device with a working microphone and speaker (smartphone or tablet).
-   **Language:** MVP is English-only.
-   **Privacy:** Users own their data. We do not train public models on private stories without explicit consent.
